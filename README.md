=========
Simple Snake Project using Java for TAMU CSCE606

The application is meant to demonstrate software reuse which is achieved here through:

1. Design patterns: The application uses a Singleton Timekeeper and the Observer design pattern to update objects per frame.
2. Frameworks: The Swing framework is used to create the GUI.
3. Properties: The parameters of the game such as speed, colors, etc. can be set via a properties file. This allows reuse of the same code base for applying different themes and difficulty levels.
